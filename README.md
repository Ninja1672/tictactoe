# Overview

For this project I was trying to get more familiar with Expo, particularly the touchable opacity buttons. The 
game is Tic-Tac-Toe, you win by getting a 3 in a row anywhere on the board, simply tap the number you wish to change and it
will change to an X or an O depending on the players turn. The button at the bottom will reset the board.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Stuidio Code as the IDE.

I programmed it in react which is javascript based, the only important library imported was for touchable opacity objects. 
These turn whatever the text or image is into touchable spaces that can perform actions on press.
